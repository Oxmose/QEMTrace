# QEMTrace

A QEMU[[1]](https://www.qemu.org) based tracer for full system memory accesses.
QEMTrace allows bare-metal and OS memory access tracing in a non-intrusive manner. It uses the virtualization provided by QEMU to collect
information about the memory accesses. We also present the different trace collection means put in place
and introduce a Shared Memory Interface (SMI) used to connect QEMTrace to any client application that
uses memory traces as input. Contrary to most work, our approach permits the collection of a wide range
of information (called meta-data) concerning memory accesses such as their type, privilege level, size, etc.
Such information can be used to precisely profile memory usage or access patterns generated by applications.

## How to use QEMTrace

QEMU is multi-platform software intended to be buildable on all modern
Linux platforms, OS-X, Win32 (via the Mingw64 toolchain) and a variety
of other UNIX targets. The simple steps to build QEMU are:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make

Additional information can also be found online via the QEMU website:
